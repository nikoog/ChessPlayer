# ChessPlayer
Python implementation of a chess game and an AI player using a game tree.
Actually, it's simply an 'ez-chess' game, as the game lacks chess features such as en passent.

Submitted March 5, 2019 as an assignment for CSC190
  ...but a project I will be updating as I learn more :)


TODO:
- en passent
